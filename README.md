## Asana menu

### Inspiration
Asana Mac OSX client, a simpler one. 
The UI on Asana Web is getting complicated, and I actually need a simple one.

### Roadmap
- Better mark complete action
- Show task details, comments

### Set up and user manual
- Compile and build with XCode
- App will launch in top bar as a star (‚≠ê), click on it.
- Click the preferences button (üîû) in app to set user API key.   
(e.g. API key can be obtained from Asana Web Account Settings(bottom left) or keep logged in in Safari).  
- Click the cross button (‚ùé) to exit the app.

### Changelog
##### v0.0.1
- Preference window to set user API key.
- Load not-completed tasks list.
- Click status text to reload task. 
- Search bar to filter tasks by task or project name
- Create new task in a project(selected from the combo)  
- Mark task as complete (just click on the checkbox)
